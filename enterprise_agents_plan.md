# Enterprise AI Agents Implementation Plan

This document outlines a detailed plan for creating 30 enterprise AI agents using the CrewAI framework. Each agent will be implemented in its own file under the "agents" directory using a structure similar to the existing HR and Calendar agents.

---

## Overall Structure

1. **Directory Organization**
   - Create an "agents" folder to store each agent’s implementation.
   - Existing files: `agents/hr.py` and `agents/calendar.py`
   - Create new files for each additional agent:
     - accounting.py
     - finance.py
     - dataprocessing.py
     - coding.py
     - text_to_speech.py
     - text_to_video.py
     - marketing.py
     - sales.py
     - customer_support.py
     - it_support.py
     - legal.py
     - procurement.py
     - inventory_management.py
     - operations.py
     - project_management.py
     - supply_chain.py
     - business_intelligence.py
     - data_science.py
     - compliance.py
     - risk_management.py
     - security.py
     - network_monitoring.py
     - software_qa.py
     - devops.py
     - business_development.py
     - rnd.py
     - social_media.py
     - executive_assistant.py

2. **Common Code Pattern (Template)**
   - For each agent, import necessary modules:
     • CrewAI components: Agent, Task, Crew
     • LLM integration: ChatOpenAI from langchain_openai
     • (If needed) integrations or external tool API modules
   - Define the agent using:
     • role: short descriptive name
     • goal: primary function and mission in context of enterprise tasks
     • backstory: brief narrative (can be customized per agent)
     • verbose flag (set to True)
     • allow_delegation flag (depending on whether agent behind logic should delegate)
     • llm: ChatOpenAI() instance
   - Define a sample Task that demonstrates the agent’s capability.
   - Instantiate a Crew with the agent (or multiple agents if collaboration is needed), call kickoff, and print the result.

   **Example Pseudocode Template:**
   -----------------------------------
   from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew
   from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
   # Optional: import any additional tools if integration is needed, e.g.:
   # from some_tool_lib import ToolX
   # tool_instance = ToolX(api_key=os.getenv('API_KEY_FOR_TOOLX'))

   agent = Agent(
       role="Agent Role Name",
       goal="Agent goal explanation (what the agent is specialized in).",
       backstory="A short background narrative explaining the agent expertise.",
       verbose=True,
       allow_delegation=False,  # or True depending on use-case
       llm=ChatOpenAI(),
       # Optionally include tools: tools=[tool_instance] if integration is needed
   )

   task = Task(
       description="Detailed task description demonstrating the agent’s function",
       agent=agent,
       expected_output="",
   )

   crew = Crew(agents=[agent], tasks=[task], verbose=True)
   result = crew.kickoff()
   print(result)
   -----------------------------------

3. **API Integration and External Tools**
   - For agents that require external integration (e.g., Text-to-Speech, Finance, Customer Support), include:
     • Import statements for the relevant libraries
     • Reading API keys from environment variables (e.g., os.getenv('API_KEY_NAME'))
     • Initialization of tool instances which can be passed to the Agent via the `tools` parameter.
   - Document where additional documentation or keys are needed.

## Implementation Steps

1. **File Creation:**  
   For each new agent listed above, create a Python file in the "agents" folder using the template (as shown in the pseudocode) and customize the role, goal, backstory, and task description.

2. **Integration Setup:**  
   - For agents that require external APIs (Finance, Text-to-Speech, etc.), add placeholder code for reading API keys (e.g., using os.getenv) and initialize the corresponding tool instances.
   - Document which external service documentation to refer to for setting up additional integrations.

3. **Testing and Validation:**  
   - Write a unit/integration test for each agent file to verify that the agent can execute a sample task.
   - Ensure that the Crew instantiation and task kickoff returns a valid result.

4. **Common Template Refactoring (Optional):**  
   - Consider extracting the common agent creation code into a shared template or function to minimize duplication across the 30 files.
   - This central template can be imported and specialized as needed per agent.

5. **Documentation:**  
   - Each file should include comments at the top describing the purpose and any required configuration (e.g., necessary API keys).

---

## Final Notes

- Each file should follow the CrewAI structure closely, ensuring consistency across the enterprise agents.
- Focus on practical business tasks and evaluate after implementation if further refinements or integrations are necessary.
- Reach out for additional API keys or detailed documentation if any specific integration requires it (e.g., Bloomberg API, Google Cloud TTS).

This plan provides a roadmap for rolling out 30 enterprise AI agents. Adjust the specifics of each agent’s implementation as needed based on enterprise priorities and available integrations.
